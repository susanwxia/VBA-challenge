# VBA-challenge
Find out the performance of various stocks through years 2014 - 2016 for the purpose of further evaluation.

In this challenge two Macros were created: StockTrend() and Formatter_GVal().

StockTrend() aims to find out the yearly change, percentage change, and total stock volume for each stock in a particular year.

Formatter_GVal() aims to conduct conditional formatting that highlights the positive/negative change in a specific color. Meanwhile, it performs a further evaluation on the stock data to find out the Greatest % increase, Greatest % decrease, and Greatest total volume in a particular year.

The Data Analysis results are shown as below:
